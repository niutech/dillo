 D+ Browser
------------

DPlus is a graphical web browser with an emphasis on security, performance,
and portability.

It is based on Dillo (http://www.dillo.org/); the name "D+" is meant to
suggest a smaller, yet improved, Dillo.  The name also serves as a concise
evaluation of the browser's rendering quality.

DPlus currently supports Windows, DOS, OS X, and Unix systems.

1. Features
-----------

  - Modern tabbed browsing interface.
  
  - Extremely low memory usage.

  - Tiny executable size (the Windows version fits on a floppy disk).

  - Standalone executable requires no installation or external dependencies;
    also supports running as a portable executable on Windows.

  - Incredible portability (see "Compatibility," below).

  - Mostly-complete support for HTML 4.01.
  
  - Partial support for CSS 2.1.
  
  - Full support for HTTP 1.1, including basic authentication and gzip
    compression.

  - Support for HTTPS (minus certificate validation) via OpenSSL or CyaSSL.

  - Always-on "private browsing" mode.
    Cookies and history are NEVER written to disk.


2. Limitations
--------------

  - Limited support for HTML 4.01 and CSS 2.1.  In particular, no support
    for floating elements, putting rendering about a decade behind Netscape 4.

  - No support for JavaScript (mostly by design).

  - No support for plugins like Flash, Java, etc. (mostly by design).

  - No support for HTML frames.

  - No support for SSL certificate validation (we pretend it's by design).
    DO NOT USE DPLUS FOR ONLINE BANKING AND OTHER SENSITIVE TRANSACTIONS.

  - No support for FTP and other non-HTTP protocols.


3. Compatibility
----------------

  - Microsoft Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Vista, and 7,
    including all x64 versions.

  - Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, using a specialized build.

  - DOS and compatible systems (tested mainly on MS-DOS 6.22 and FreeDOS).

  - All recent Linux/Unix systems.  Linux binary packages are available
    for current CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, RHEL, and Ubuntu releases.

  - Mac OS X should work, but has not been tested by the developer.
    Mainline Dillo has been reported to run fine.

  - Theoretically any other platform with a sockets library and FLTK 1.3.


4. Project History
------------------

DPlus continues where Dillo-Win32 (http://dillo-win32.sourceforge.net/)
left off, providing an enhanced Dillo browser with significantly improved
usability, performance, and portability over the mainline release.

Unlike Dillo-Win32, DPlus is a completely separate project and will no
longer attempt to maintain upstream compatibility, as the mainline developers
have made abundantly clear they are not interested in outside contributions.

The initial release, DPlus 0.5, is forked from the final Dillo-Win32 3.0p9
release.  It will essentially be "Dillo-Win32 improved," with a cleaner user
interface, greater portability, numerous bugfixes, and a less misleading name
than the original program; only the renderer remains largely untouched.

At the moment there are no plans for long-term development.
I (Benjamin Johnson) am releasing DPlus because, despite my sworn intention
never to touch the Dillo code again, I have found it useful and necessary for
my own purposes to fix a few glaring problems in Dillo-Win32.  However,
developing a web browser requires planning and commitment, and I have neither
the time nor interest to make this anything more than a one-off release.
