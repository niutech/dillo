The DPlus icon font is Georgia Bold Italic.

The icon is deliberately simple because some platforms, including older
versions of Windows, only support 16-color icons regardless of the user's
display settings or color depth; we would rather it look exactly consistent
across all platforms than extraordinarily beautiful on a select few.
